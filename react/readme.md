**Description:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations. React allows developers to create large web-applications that use data and can change over time without reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability. React processes only user interfaces in applications, corresponding to the View in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

**History:** React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by Angular and XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.
